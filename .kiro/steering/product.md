# Product Overview

This is an academic observatory site that showcases and describes:
- Research, Extension, and Education projects
- Research activities and outputs
- Students and their work
- Scholarships and funding opportunities

Built as a static site with Astro for performance, SEO, and easy content management. The site serves as a central hub for presenting academic work and connecting stakeholders with research initiatives, educational programs, and scholarship information.

## Data-Driven Architecture

The site is JSON-driven: content is stored in JSON files, and Astro dynamically generates pages from this data at build time. This approach enables:
- Easy content updates without code changes
- Consistent data structure across the site
- Scalable content management
- Static output with dynamic generation
